# Disorganiser

SDL2 based UI for several raspberry pis with touchscreens for either commanding
other machines and showing info, like the time and weather, or acting as an
active picture frame.

The GUI coding and higher level is handled with Lua, and the handling of SSH to control my other
PCs, and lower graphical machinery is done in C++.

It also host a few experiments, where the built in Lua, Lua console and graphics capability help.

Called "Disorganiser" in reference to the same in a book by my favorite author,
Sir Terry Pratchet. -- <https://wiki.lspace.org/Dis-organiser>

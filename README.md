# Disorganiser
SDL2 based UI for my raspberry pi with 7" touchscreen for commanding other machines and showing info, like the time and weather.

The GUI coding is handled with Lua, and the handling of SSH to control my other PCs, and lower graphical machinery is done in C++.

Called "Disorganiser" in reference to the same in a book by my favorite author, Sir Terry Pratchet. -- https://wiki.lspace.org/Dis-organiser

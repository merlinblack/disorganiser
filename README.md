# Hub Commander
SDL2 based UI for my raspberry pi with 7" touchscreen for commanding other machines and showing info, like the time and weather.

The actual GUI coding will be handled with Lua, where C++ will handle using SSH to controll my other PCs and posibly using HTTPS requests to get data for display.
